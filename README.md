some shell scripts that come handy for *nix power-users

## favos.sh
Who doesn't like a fresh start?
But it shouldn't be to fresh, right?
So in order to jump right in, I prefer installing all the stuff I need at once.

## pdfmerge.sh
this innocent script came very handy while I was looking for a job.
I used this script to compile the application doc to one of my cv's (one has a casual pic, the other has a business pic) and all the rest, all together generating a pdf of approx. 30 pages.
I must say this was always the nicest moment during that time, watching ghostscript rendering the pdfs page by page like something really was happening.
